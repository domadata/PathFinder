# PathFinder

App that gives you the shortest path / distance between A and B.

It currently only has Dijkstra algorithm that gives you the shortest distance.

I created a new rep for this because my other rep ```PathFinderDFSAnimation``` didnt support any other algorithm and the DFS algorithm was nothing but an animation and not the right algorithm.

The app supports adding new algorithms to it, looking into the source should show you how to.

# Running
